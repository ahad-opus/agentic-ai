# Agentic AI

A modern framework for building agentic AI interfaces that enable AI systems to interact seamlessly with users and their environment.

## Overview

Agentic AI provides a comprehensive toolkit for developing AI agents that can:

- **Understand user intent** through natural language processing
- **Take autonomous actions** based on goals and constraints
- **Interact with external systems** via API integrations
- **Learn from feedback** to improve performance over time
- **Explain their reasoning** for transparency and trust

## Key Features

- üß† **Cognitive Architecture**: Modular design for reasoning, planning, and execution
- üîÑ **Feedback Loops**: Built-in mechanisms for learning from user interactions
- üõ†Ô∏è **Tool Integration**: Framework for connecting to external APIs and services
- üîç **Context Management**: Sophisticated handling of conversation and task context
- üß© **Composable Components**: Mix and match capabilities to build custom agents
- üîí **Safety Guardrails**: Configurable constraints to ensure responsible AI behavior

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install via npm
npm install agentic-ai

# Or via yarn
yarn add agentic-ai
```

## Basic Usage

```javascript
import { Agent, Memory, Tools } from 'agentic-ai';

// Create an agent with memory and tools
const myAgent = new Agent({
  name: "ResearchAssistant",
  memory: new Memory.Contextual(),
  tools: [
    new Tools.WebSearch(),
    new Tools.DocumentReader(),
    new Tools.TextSummarizer()
  ]
});

// Define a task for the agent
const task = {
  goal: "Research recent advances in quantum computing",
  constraints: {
    maxTime: "10 minutes",
    sourcesRequired: true
  }
};

// Run the agent on the task
const result = await myAgent.run(task);
console.log(result.summary);
console.log(result.sources);
```

## Architecture

Agentic AI is built on a modular architecture that separates:

1. **Perception**: Processing inputs from users and environment
2. **Cognition**: Reasoning about goals and planning actions
3. **Action**: Executing plans through tool use and API calls
4. **Memory**: Storing and retrieving relevant context
5. **Learning**: Improving performance based on feedback

This separation allows for flexible agent design while maintaining a consistent framework.
